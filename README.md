# PDD Collection
This carefully curated collection thoroughly explores the evolution, techniques, and historical context of lie detection (Psychophysiological Detection of Deception) practices. It includes a diverse range of historical artifacts and literature, featuring classical works such as 'Fear' by Mosso, 'On the Witness Stand' by MÃ¼nsterberg, 'Lying and its Detection' by Larson, Haney, and Keeler, and 'The Nature of Human Conflicts' by Luria, providing insights into the early foundations of lie detection. Authoritative texts like 'Lie Detection and Criminal Interrogation' by Inbau, 'Polygraph for the Defense' and 'Polygraph in Court' by Ferguson & Miller, along with 'Legal Admissibility of the Polygraph' by Ansley and 'Tremor in the Blood' by Lykken, offer critical perspectives on the legal and scientific dimensions of polygraphy. Many books in this collection are first editions, first American editions, and signed by authors. This privately available collection is open for purchase, and can be a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, or anyone seeking insights into the realm of lie detection.
